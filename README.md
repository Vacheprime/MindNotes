# MindNotes

This web application is a note taking application create as part of the final project of the Internet Programming course at Vanier College.
The app allows users to create notes, save them locally, categorize them by a subject, and create links between notes to join similar ideas 
or concepts together. The website features a minimalistic design: simple UI elements, color palette, and fonts.

## Implementation Tasks

To create this website, here is a list of the implementation tasks that need to be completed:

-     Write the static HTML for the about, create note page, and stats pages. 

-     Write the template HTML for the view note pages, bookmarked note pages, linked note pages, and note page view pages. 

-     Write the CSS stylesheets using the chosen fonts and color palette for all of the html pages. 

-     Write the JavaScript code to validate the user input using the Validity object in the create note page section. 

-     Write the text input widget for the note page view. This can be done using a third-party library like Quill.js. 

-     Write the JavaScript code for saving note page information in JSON format on the browser’s local storage. 

-     Write the JavaScript code for retrieving note page information in JSON format from the browser’s local storage. 

-     Use AJAX to update the text input widget with the saved notes. This code will be executed when a note page is opened. 

-     Implement error or message dialogs using JQuery. 

-     Write the JavaScript code to implement bookmarking and note linking. 

-     Write the JavaScript code to dynamically generate the bookmarked note pages page using the DOM API. 

-     Write the JavaScript code to dynamically generate the linked note pages page using the DOM API. 

-     Write the JavaScript code to dynamically generate the view note pages page using the DOM API. 

-     Write the JavaScript code to fetch a daily inspirational quote and dynamically add it to the homepage.
