# MindNotes

This web application is a note taking application create as part of the final project of the Internet Programming course at Vanier College.
The app allows users to create notes, save them locally, categorize them by a subject, and create links between notes to join similar ideas 
or concepts together. The website features a minimalistic design: simple UI elements, color palette, and fonts.
